write a program to check whether a string is Palindrom or not?
Approch:-
There are two method for this 
1)By using Recurrsion
2)By using high and low pointer

1) Recursive Approch
check the base condition like 
(n==0) 
return ture
(start!=end)  retrun false 
 (start==end)  check for further string 
if (start<end+1) , call the function with smaller input as 
recPalindrom(str,s+1 ,e-1)
 return ture

2)High and Low pointer 
initialize high as n-1 and low as 0
loop for (h>1) 
check if str[l] == str[h] ,increament both 
retrun ture else false
